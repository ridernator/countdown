# Tool to solve the [Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_Round) numbers problems

## Build Instructions
Type "cmake", then type "make"

## Run Instructions
Something along the lines of:
```
./countdown 25 50 4 3 8 456
```
Where the first 5 numbers are the input numbers and the last number is the target

You don't need to follow the Countdown rules. You can go crazy and do something like:
```
./countdown 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 456
```

N.B This will not find the best solution. Only **a** solution if one exists
